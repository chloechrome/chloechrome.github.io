			Welcome to the Providence Wiki site. Written in html by <a href='https://chloechrome.github.io' target='_blank'>MonochromeHD</a>.

				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Providence is a sci-fi multimedia setting focused on remaining more sci-fi than fantasy. After the scorching of eastern parts of the Sadon commonwealth,
					new civilisations develop within the burnt-out wasteland, which will henceforth be called the Resemblance. One such civilisation is New Eden, the city-state that was reborn from the ash. New Eden is 
					politically divided between expansionists, who wish to further the goals of pre-war Eden (conquering the Resemblance), and reservists, who believe New Eden should focus on developing their own city. 
					In the other axis are those who support Eden's ruling Knights' Council and those who deny its authority.</p>
					
				<p><br>Within the wiki, I will be implementing a Shell system. Each piece of content will have a shell it resides in, relating to its distance from the core foundations of the setting:
				<br><br>CORE: The most constant parts of this world. Anything that is CORE is unlikely to change to any great degree. Rewriting will only take place after making sure no plot holes are created as it is part of the core idea that the rest is built upon.
				<br><br>HELD: Held concepts are in firm orbit around the core and form the main features and storylines.
				<br><br>FREE: Free concepts are stray ideas and brief excerpts that need developing before they can become part of the canon.
				<br><br>In addition, each wiki page will have a colour tag:
				<br><img src='ast/grey.png' width='8'></img><a style='color:grey'> Grey</a>	- my own content, which will likely make up the vast majority of Providence;
				<br><img src='ast/wine.png' width='8'></img><a style='color:662222'> Wine</a> - content created by myself, directly using ideas given to me by users of the Achromatic Collective;
				<br><img src='ast/red.png' width='8'></img><a style='color:AA2222'> Red</a> - content created entirely by (or with little input from myself) the users of the Achromatic Collective. I will only add pages under this tag if I believe they truly fit the setting;
				<br><img src='ast/blue.png' width='8'></img><a style='color:2255AA'> Blue</a> - content I have adapted directly from elsewhere with too few changes to be considered greytagged.
				<br><br>These systems will replace Exo's "Levels" system previously in use.</p>
					Currently planned works are as follows:</p>
				<li>[CORE] Lazarus Rises - The story of Angel Unit 7's journey through the Resemblance in search of purpose.</li>
				<br><li>[HELD] House Advantage - One madman flees New Eden; the Angels have the upper hand.</li>
				<br><li>[HELD] Somewhere Brighter - Expands the world beyond the Resemblance, acts as an epilogue to House Advantage.</li>
				<br><li>[HELD] Visions of Apocalypse - Origin of the Angel Units and Saimonite lore.</li>
