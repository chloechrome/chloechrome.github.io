					<div class='cent'><h3>Original</h3></div>
					<li>Made by: The White Stripes</li>
					<li>BPM: 124</li>
					<li>Length: 3:52</li>
					<li>Instrumentation: Electric-acoustic guitar played through a pitch shift effect to imitate bass, drumkit</li>
					<li>Key: E Minor</li>
					<li>Genre: Garage Rock</li>
					<div class='cent'><h4>About Genre</h4></div>
					<p>Characterised by basic chords and simple lyrics, often associated with small bands formed in the suburbs who would rehearse in a band member's garage. Although many bands were picked up by large record companies, the term "garage rock" was retroactively used to describe these bands due to their similar sound.</p>
					<p>The song has a very simplistic "heartbeat" drum with a kick on every beat and a snare on the off-beats that persists through the whole piece, save for select solo sections. This simplicity, along with the memorable but easy bassline, makes this song a good fit for "garage rock".</p>

					<div class='cent'><h3>Remix</h3></div>
					<li>Made by: The Glitch Mob</li>
					<li>BPM: 120 (-4 from original)</li>
					<li>Length: 4:17 (+0:15 from original)</li>
					<li>Instrumentation: Synth bass, drumkit<br><br></li>
					<li>Key: E Minor</li>
					<li>Genre: Dubstep</li>
					<div class='cent'><h4>About Genre</h4></div>
					<p>One characteristic of dubstep is prominent basslines and rhythm. The tempo is usually within 132-142 beats per minute.</p>
					<p>In this remix, the original guitar has been replaced with a synthesised bass with heavy distortion and glitching effects; the drums have been raised in the mix and made more powerful, however this is most likely done with effects applied to the original stem rather than a synthesised kit. Interestingly, the tempo is lowered from 124 to 120BPM, rather than raised as would be typical of a dubtep piece.<br><br></p>

					<div class='cent'><h3>Original</h3></div>
					<li>Made by: Franz Ferdinand</li>
					<li>BPM: 105</li>
					<li>Length: 3:57</li>
					<li>Instrumentation: Electric guitar & bass, drumkit</li><br>
					<li>Key: E Minor</li>
					<li>Genre: Indie Rock</li>
					<div class='cent'><h4>About Genre</h4></div>
					<p>A subgenre of rock that originally was associated with low-budget, DIY records but later encompassed higher budget acts with a similar sound. Although the term does not necessarily refer to one rigid style, some common characteristics are minimal editing, melodic focus and interesting lyrics.</p>
					<p>The song starts with a guitar driven uptempo section before switching to a slower section at around 50 seconds. It was recorded as one take (rather than the best parts of multiple takes being spliced together) and the lyrics focus on the dual meaning of its title.<br><br><br><br></p>

					<div class='cent'><h3>Remix</h3></div>
					<li>Made by: Naum Gabo</li>
					<li>BPM: 132 (+28 from original)</li>
					<li>Length: 5:04 (+1:07 from original)</li>
					<li>Instrumentation: Synth keys, metronome click, electric guitar, synthesised bass, synthesised drums.</li>
					<li>Key: D Major</li>
					<li>Genre: EDM</li>
					<div class='cent'><h4>About Genre</h4></div>
					<p>EDM is a broad term that generally refers to any music made for use in a nightclub or other social event. As such, its notable characteristics are high energy, fast songs with easy time signatures that can be danced to.</p>
					<p>The Naum Gabo remix essentially extends the first part of the song, with none of the second. Despite being both longer and faster, it cuts out a large portion of the vocals and is largely instrumental. The faster tempo and lack of vocals makes it more practical for dancing to, a key characteristic of the genre. One especially noticeable change is the much more prominent drums with a four to the floor beat, which are also synthesised rather than using the original kit. There is use of a guitar lead which appears to be taken from the original piece's rhyhm guitar.</p>
